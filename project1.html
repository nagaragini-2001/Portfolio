            <h1>🛒 Zepto Clone – Instant Grocery Delivery Web App</h1>
            <div>
                <h3>🔍 Overview</h3>
                <p>The Zepto Clone is a front-end web application inspired by the popular instant grocery delivery
                    service, Zepto. This project simulates a real-world e-commerce experience and was developed to
                    enhance my skills in React, state management, and responsive UI design.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>🎯 Purpose</h3>
                <p>To replicate the functionality and user experience of a modern grocery delivery app, focusing on:

                    Front-end development best practices.

                    Component-based architecture.

                    Real-world application features like cart management, search, and filtering.

                    Mobile-first responsive design.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>🚀 Key Features</h3>
                <p>✅ Responsive UI built with React and Tailwind CSS.

                    🔎 Real-time Search and Category Filtering.

                    🛒 Cart Functionality with add/remove/update capabilities.

                    💾 Cart persistence using localStorage.

                    🔐 Optional User Authentication (via Firebase or mock auth).

                    📦 Product Listing Pages grouped by categories.

                    🧾 Order Summary & Checkout UI.

                    🛠️ Admin Dashboard for product management (optional).

                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3> Challenges & Solutions</h3>
                <p>One big challenge was managing application state across many components like the cart, product list,
                    and filters.

                    I solved this by using React Context API (or Redux, if you used it) to centralize state and make it
                    easier to manage and debug.

                    Another challenge was ensuring the UI was truly responsive, especially the category scroll and cart
                    sidebar. I overcame this by adopting a mobile-first design and testing across different screen sizes
                    using Chrome DevTools.

                    I also had to deal with performance issues when filtering large lists, so I used memoization and
                    debounce to optimize re-renders.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Final learning outcome</h3>
                <p>Deepened my understanding of React hooks, component structuring, and state flow.

                    Improved skills in UI/UX design, responsive layouts, and performance optimization.

                    Learned to debug, test, and simulate real-world product features.

                    Gained experience that closely resembles building a production-grade front-end application.</p>
